# What is IP Address? 
IP is defined as Internet protocol. in simple words it is used to establish a network between different devices(computers,smartphone,smartTVs etc.) he 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period (dot)
ip address is divided into two versions .**IPv4**,**IPv6**
. IPv4 is the older version which has an space of over 4 billion IP addresses. However, the new IPv6 version can provide up to trillions of IP addresses to fulfill the need of all internet users and devices.
There are a few types of IP addresses like private IP addresses, public IP addresses, static IP addresses and dynamic IP addresses. Let’s talk about these different types of IP addresses one by one:
## **Private IP Address**
A private IP address is the address of your device connected on the home or business network. If you have a few different devices connected to one ISP (Internet Service Provider), then all your devices will have a unique private IP address. This IP address cannot be accessed from devices outside your home or business network.
For example: 192.168.1.1
Private IP addresses are not unique because there are limited number of devices on your network.

## **Public IP Address**
Your public IP address is the main IP address to which your home or business network is connected. This IP address connects you to the world, and it’s unique for all users.
## **Static and Dynamic IP Addresses**
All private and public IP addresses can be either static or dynamic. IP addresses that you configure manually and fix them to the network of your device are called static IP addresses. Static IP addresses cannot change automatically.

The dynamic IP address configures automatically and assign an IP to your network when you set up the router with internet. This distribution of IP addresses is managed by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP can be your internet router that assigns an IP address to your network in your home or business environment.

# Subnetting
it is required when we need more networks in a ip . basically we borrow some bits from Host and give them to network. so we can increase the number of networks.
Each data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnetworks, it allows you to create a network of interconnecting subnetworks. Each data link on this network would then have a unique network/subnetwork ID. Any device, or gateway, that connects _n_ networks/subnetworks has _n_ distinct IP addresses, one for each network / subnetwork that it interconnects.
